```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ 
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (If building Sync Server or WASM modules)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Run Development Server

```sh
# Run frontend dev server
npm run dev

# Or open in browser automatically
npm run dev -- --open
```

The frontend will run at `http://localhost:5173/khun-phaen-tracker-offline` (base path configured).

### 3. Run Sync Server (Optional - for Real-time Sync)

In another terminal:

```sh
cd sync-server
cargo run --release
```

The Sync Server will run at `http://localhost:3001`

### 4. Build WASM Modules (Optional)

To build WASM modules yourself:

```sh
# Build wasm-compress
cd wasm-compress
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Build wasm-crdt
cd ../wasm-crdt
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Build wasm-search
cd ../wasm-search
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Why run tests?

- Reduce bugs when modifying code, especially for critical flows like task creation/editing, filtering, and bulk actions.
- Catch regressions early before production.
- Refactor with confidence knowing existing behaviors are preserved.

### How tests work?

- Uses `Vitest` as the test runner.
- `unit` suite is for logic and component/UI tests.
- Scans for `*.test.ts` files in `src/`.
- Watch mode automatically reruns tests on file changes.

### Commands

```sh
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run DB logic tests specifically
npx vitest run src/lib/db.unit.test.ts

# Run unit/component tests only
npx vitest run --project unit

# Run specific test file
npx vitest run --project unit src/lib/components/TaskForm.test.ts
```

## 📚 Storybook (UI Documentation)

### Why Storybook?

- Visualize and interact with components in isolation.
- Prevent UI regressions by comparing different component states.
- Serves as living documentation for developers and reviewers.

### Usage

```sh
# Run Storybook locally
npm run storybook
```
Available at `http://localhost:6006`

## 🏭 Build for Production

```sh
# Build Frontend
npm run build

# Build Sync Server (Binary)
cd sync-server
cargo build --release
```

## 🐳 Docker / Deployment

### Sync Server ONLY

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name khu-phaen-sync \
  --memory=100m \
  -p 3002:3001 \
  ghcr.io/watchakorn-18k/khun-phaen-tracker-offline/sync-server:latest
```
